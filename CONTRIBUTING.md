# Contributing to Build Here (`bh`)

Contribution to this program are welcome!

## Guidelines

Follow Rust best practices. I don't really know what these are, but
I'm working to learn them.

## Types of contributions

I welcome all sorts of contributions, but I'm especially looking for
the following:

* **Improvements to the code** &mdash; This is my first Rust project.
  I would appreciate any tips or hints on how I can improve the code.

* **New tools** &mdash; The current selection of build tools is very
  limited. I would appreciate any new tool suggestions. You can email
  me with suggestions, but a pull request would be even better.
